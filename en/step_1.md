Right-click (or if you are using a tablet, tap and hold) on your first sprite in the Sprite list below the Stage:
![The Sprite list with first sprite highlighted and pop up menu showing duplicate, export and delete options.](images/challenge1-right-click-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Select **duplicate**. This will create a copy of your first sprite, with the suffix "2":
![The Sprite list showing the first sprite and the duplicate sprite.](images/challenge1-duplicate-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Rename your sprite:
![The sprite properties pane with the Sprite field highlighted.](images/challenge1-rename-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Your sprite's name will change in the Sprite list:
![The Sprite list showing the duplicate sprite with a new name.](images/challenge1-sprite-list.png){:width="300px"}

Your second sprite has exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have started to change the second sprite's code â€” you might not see the second sprite because it might be positioned underneath the first sprite.
