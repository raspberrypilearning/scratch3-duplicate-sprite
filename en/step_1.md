## Duplicate a Sprite in Scratch3

Right-click on your first sprite in the Sprite list below the Stage (or if you are using a tablet, tap and hold):
![Image right click first sprite](images/challenge1-right-click-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Select **duplicate**. This will create a copy of your first sprite with the suffix "2":
![Image duplicate sprite](images/challenge1-duplicate-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Rename your sprite:
![Image rename sprite](images/challenge1-rename-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Your sprite's name will change in the Sprite list:
![Image change name in list](images/challenge1-sprite-list.png){:width="300px"}

Your second sprite has exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have started to change the second sprite's code â€” you will not see the second sprite because it is positioned underneath the first sprite.
